# What is Kwargs DJ?

Or, better yet, "**Who** is Kwargs DJ?". Kwargs DJ is a fully digital artist, who will hopefully become the worlds first completely autonomous musician.

# Ideas

## Songs
- Use MelodyRNN to create primers, which can be repeated in the background to add further structure to the song. To condition Melody RNN on a chord progression, one could simply use it as the primer.
- Have different "blocks" of sound Kwargs DJ can randomly choose from at each section of a song
    - Intro blocks, Chorus blocks, Verse blocks, Bridge blocks, Outro blocks;
    - or simply Top Blocks, Middle Blocks, Bottom Blocks
- Could also generate a simple chord progression and use ImprovRNN (or [chord-conditined MusicVAE](https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-demos/blob/master/colab-notebooks/Multitrack_MusicVAE.ipynb)), which will likely sound more human
- `pychord` is a python library for handling chords. It might come in handy for this project.
- A solo could be done using the [Piano Transformer](https://github.com/asigalov61/Google-Magenta-Piano-Transformer-Colab). Maybe look into [transfer learning](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/magenta-discuss/c/tRrth7wXF6U) from the Transformer using the Lakh dataset.
- Tap2Drums model can be used to add drums to any melody with consistent tempo, as long as we turn that melody into a Tap beforehand (single pitch NoteSequence) as done by [Drumbot](https://github.com/magenta/drumbot) and [Drumify](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-studio).
- A certain degree of instrument randomness (e.g. different piano synths) will add much needed variety to the songs composed by the DJ

## Lyrics

- Separate one of the MIDI tracks generated by the DJ as described above and use [midi2voice](https://github.com/mathigatti/midi2voice)

## Cover art
- use [Arbitrary Style Transfer](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization) to and from Creative Commons art (paintings and/or photographs) to create album covers. [Here](https://www.moma.co.uk/buy/hello-marine-prints/) is an example of art style I believe to be fitting.
